# Audio-For-ML

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks focused on extracting basic audio features for Machine Learning tasks. 

## Contents

- **`AmpEnvelope.ipynb`**: Explores the extraction of the Amplitude Envelope from audio signals. The Amplitude Envelope gives a rough idea of the loudness of the signal and is useful for tasks like onset detection.
- **`RMSandZCR.ipynb`**: Covers the extraction of Root Mean Square (RMS) energy and Zero-Crossing Rate (ZCR). RMS is an indicator of the perceived loudness, and ZCR helps in identifying the percussive or noisy nature of a sound, often used in speech/music discrimination.
- **`AudioFiles/`**: Directory meant to store audio samples used by the notebooks.

## Usage

1. Place your audio files (e.g., `.wav`) in the `AudioFiles/` directory.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebooks to see the feature extraction in action.
3. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed (typically `librosa`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`).

## Features Covered
- **Amplitude Envelope (AE)**: Maximum amplitude value within a given frame.
- **Root Mean Square (RMS) Energy**: The root mean square of the amplitude within a frame.
- **Zero-Crossing Rate (ZCR)**: The rate at which the signal changes sign (goes from positive to negative or vice-versa).
